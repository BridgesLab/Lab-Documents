# Lab Protocol Site

Setting up laboratory procedures and making them accessible to our group was a priority when we were getting set up.  Going back to when I was a postdoctoral fellow, we had set up a mediawiki site for some of the postdocs to remember how to make up TBST, or what voltage to set electroporations at.  All of our lab procedures, big and small are listed on this wiki, which is open for anyone to see.  Some examples from our recent papers are

* [Extraction of DNA from TRIZOL preparations](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/protocols/Extraction_of_DNA_from_TRIZOL_preparations) (ie for mtDNA copy number determination) 
* [Standard High Fat Diet Protocol](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/protocols/High_Fat_Diet_Treatment)
* [Insulin Tolerance Tests](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/protocols/Tests Insulin_Tolerance_Test)
* [Triglyceride Assay](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/protocols/Triglyceride_Assay_from_Cells_and_Tissues)

# Materals for Writing NIH F-Series Fellowships

With the support of the [Elizabeth Weiser Caswell Diabetes Institute](https://diabetes.med.umich.edu/) I am running a six week workshop on writing effective F30, F31 and F32 applications.  The idea is to space out the writing into draft and review phases, and to have all the applicants peer review each other's materials.  All the materials are open source and free to be re-used if anyone finds them helpful.  They can be found [here](https://bridgeslab.github.io/FellowshipWorkshopDocuments/).

The structure of the workshop is such that documents will be read once, and reviewed again once within the 6 weeks

As of 2026 the Fellowship documents have been updated.  [Here is my summary](https://bridgeslab.github.io/FellowshipWorkshopDocuments/Documents/F31_PAF_Comparason.html) of what has changed with the new review criteria and change in forms

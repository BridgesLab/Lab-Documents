After reading several excellent books on the differences betwen frequentist and Bayesian statistics ([Bernoulli's Fallacy: Statistical Illogic and the Crisis of Modern Science](https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780231199957) by Aubrey Clayton and [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143125082) by Nate Silver), I decided to try to try to explore a way to do practically implement Bayesian statistics in our research.  For our purposes the [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) package seems to be the most robust interface.  Here are a few resources I compiled on our [Lab Documents](https://bridgeslab.github.io/Lab-Documents/)s page that might help explain the rational and how to do this.

* [Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis](https://bridgeslab.github.io/Lab-Documents/Experimental%20Policies/bayesian-analyses.html)
* [Sample Code for Bayesian Data Analyses](https://bridgeslab.github.io/Lab-Documents/Experimental%20Policies/bayesian-examples.html)
* [Using BARG Principles for Bayesian Data Analyses](https://bridgeslab.github.io/Lab-Documents/Experimental%20Policies/bayesian-barg.html)

Any feedback would be welcome, including if anyone sees any examples of Bayesian statistics in molecular physiology or nutrition papers.

We just found out that our paper on transcriptional changes in adipose tissue as a result of Cushing's disease won an award as the best paper in the Journal of Molecular Endocrinology for 2015.  This paper was also selected as the cover image for that issue of the journal.  Dave will accept the award on behalf of our team at the [2016 Society for Endocrinology Annual Meeting](http://www.endocrinology.org/meetings/2016/sfebes2016/) in Brighton, UK.  All SfE journal award winners are available [here](http://www.endocrinology.org/grants/award_journal.aspx).

In that paper we described changes adipose tissue mRNA levels in subjects with Cushing's disease.  We found striking changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, proteolysis and glucose oxidation.  Studies in mice treated with a synthetic glucocorticoid confirmed many of these changes in a controlled model system.  Our work has since continued to try to understand the important roles of adipose biology in glucocorticoid action.  Our team is thrilled with this honor, and we look forward to continuing this exciting work.

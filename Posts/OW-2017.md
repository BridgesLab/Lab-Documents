[Innocence](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/innocence-harvey/), [JeAnna](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/jeanna-redd/) and [Dave](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/dave-bridges/) are all traveling to [Obesity Week](http://obesityweek.com/) to attend the annual conference of the [Obesity Society](http://www.obesity.org/home).  We are looking forward to hearing the newest research into obesity, the mechanisms that drive it and the problems associated with it.
This year our group is presenting a couple of posters:

* Elevated Glucocorticoids in the Presence of Obesity Leads to Worsened Metabolic Syndrome.  **Innocence Harvey**, Quynh Tran, Erin Stephenson, Irit Hochberg and Dave Bridges.  This will be presented at the Chronic Disease Risk: Obesity, Inflammation, DysMetabolism session on Friday, November 4th, between 12:00 and 1:30.  This poster was selected as one of 10 winners in the annual Basic Science Section Poster Competition.
* Disrupting individual *Bdnf* promoter-derived transcripts leads to distinct body composition phenotypes.  **Liam McAllan**, Kristen R. Maynard, Jyothi Parvathareddy, Oksana Gavrilova, Keri Martinowich, Dave Bridges, and Joan C. Han.  This will be presented at The Brain at the Helm of Food Intake and Energy Balance Regulation on Wednesday, November 2nd 12:00 and 1:30.

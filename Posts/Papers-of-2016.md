# Our Favorite Papers of 2016

Every year we like to come up with some of the papers we really enjoyed reading this year during our journal club (see [here]() for last year's papers).  Here are some of our favorites from this year

## Modulation of Energy Expenditure

* Liu D, Bordicchia M, Zhang C, Fang H, Wei W, Li J-L, Guilherme A, Guntur K, Czech MP, Collins S. **Activation of mTORC1 is essential for β-adrenergic stimulation of adipose browning.** J Clin Invest. 2016; 126: 1704–16. [doi: 10.1172/JCI83532](http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI83532).

This paper from [Sheila Collins's lab](http://www.sbpdiscovery.org/team/sheila-collins-phd) at Sanford Burhnam Prebys Medical Discovery Institute showed that adrenergic stimuli, including cold stress can activate [mTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1) (in addition to the better known anabolic stimuli such as growth factors, amino acids and AMPK inhibition) in adipose tissue. but then showed that adipose mTORC1 activity is essential for maintaining thermal stability upon cold stress.  This highlights the important role of mTORC1 not only in anabolic, but also in catabolic responses to over-nutrition - [Dave](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/dave-bridges/).

* Long JZ, Svensson KJ, Bateman LA, Lin H, Kamenecka T, Lokurkar IA, Lou J, Rao RR, Chang MRR, Jedrychowski MP, Paulo JA, Gygi SP, Griffin PR, et al. **The Secreted Enzyme PM20D1 Regulates Lipidated Amino Acid Uncouplers of Mitochondria.** Cell. 2016; 166: 424–35. [doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071).

Towards the end of the calendar year, this paper led by [Bruce Spiegelman's group](http://research4.dfci.harvard.edu/spiegelmanlab/) at Harvard Medical School identified a surprising factor secreted from [brown adipose tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue) (PM20D1) that causes the generation of acylated amino acids.  These acylated amino acids (particularly C18:1-Leu or Phe) increased energy expenditure in cultured muscle and adipose cells as well as in mice - [Dave](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/dave-bridges/).  

## Regulation of Lipid Metabolism

* Kim M-S, Krawczyk SA, Doridot L, Fowler AJ, Wang JX, Trauger SA, Noh H, Kang HJ, Meissen JK, Blatnik M, Kim JK, Lai M, Herman MA. **ChREBP regulates fructose-induced glucose production independently of insulin signaling.** J Clin Invest. 2016; 126: 4372–86. [doi: 10.1172/JCI81993](http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI81993).

This paper from [Mark Herman's group](http://www.bidmc.org/Research/Departments/Medicine/Divisions/Endocrinology/Laboratories/Herman-Lab.aspx) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center showed the dramatic responses of [ChREBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate-responsive_element-binding_protein) to fructose, and how glucoregulatory responses to both a fructose and a glucagon challenge are ablated in ChREBP knockouts.  They then show that fructose-induced activation of ChREBP targets are independent of insulin signaling.  These studies are consistent with a model in which fructose exacerbates hyperglycemia and *de novo* lipogenesis, independent of hyperinsulinemia - [Dave](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/dave-bridges/).

* Kim HJ, Cha JY, Seok JW, Choi Y, Yoon BK, Choi H, Yu JH, Song SJ, Kim A, Lee H, Kim D, Han JY, Kim J. **Dexras1 links glucocorticoids to insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling in adipogenesis.** Sci Rep. Nature Publishing Group; 2016; 6: 28648. [doi: 10.1038/srep28648](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep28648).

Kim *et al.* found that Dexras1, a glucocorticoid receptor target (confirmed by ChIP), is required for insulin-induced p-ERK signaling during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This happens via insulin signaling through the IGF-1 receptor, along with chaperone proteins, allowing for translocation of Dexras1 to the plasma membrane. The process is blocked when the protein is mutated or when the IGF-1 receptor is silenced - [Innocence](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/innocence-harvey/).

* Mueller KM, Hartmann K, Kaltenecker D, Vettorazzi S, Bauer M, Mauser L, Amann S, Jall S, Fischer K, Esterbauer H, Müller TD, Tschöp MH, Magnes C, et al. Adipocyte Glucocorticoid Receptor Deficiency Attenuates Aging- and Hfd-Induced Obesity, and Impairs the Feeding-Fasting Transition. Diabetes. 2016; : db160381. [doi: 10.2337/db16-0381](http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db16-0381).

In this article Mueller and colleagues investigate the role of the glucocorticoid receptor in adipose tissue (using adipose tissue specific GR KO mice) in the development of insulin resistance and fatty liver under a multitude of circumstances such as aging, HFD-induced obesity and prolonged fasting. The overall findings indicate that ablation of the GR solely in adipose tissue results in enhanced insulin sensitivity, decreased lipolysis, decreased subcutaneous and visceral fat mass and cell volume and prevents liver steatosis - [Innocence](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/innocence-harvey/).

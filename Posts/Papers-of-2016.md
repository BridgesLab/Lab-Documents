# Our Favorite Papers of 2016

Every year we like to come up with some of the papers we really enjoyed reading this year during our journal club (see [here]() for last year's papers).  Here are some of our favorites from this year

## Regulation of Energy Expenditure

* Liu D, Bordicchia M, Zhang C, Fang H, Wei W, Li J-L, Guilherme A, Guntur K, Czech MP, Collins S. Activation of mTORC1 is essential for &beta;-adrenergic stimulation of adipose browning. J Clin Invest. 2016; 1: 1–13. [doi: 10.1172/JCI83532](http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/JCI83532).

This paper from [Shelia Collins's lab](http://www.sbpdiscovery.org/team/sheila-collins-phd) at Sanford Burhnam Prebys Medical Discovery Institute showed that adrenergic stimuli, including cold stress can activate [mTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1) (in addition to the better known anabolic stimuli such as growth factors, amino acids and AMPK inhibition) in adipose tissue. but then showed that adipose mTORC1 activity is essential for maintaining thermal stability upon cold stress.  This highlights the important role of mTORC1 not only in anabolic, but also in catabolic responses to over-nutrition.

* Long JZ, Svensson KJ, Bateman LA, Lin H, Kamenecka T, Lokurkar IA, Lou J, Rao RR, Chang MRR, Jedrychowski MP, Paulo JA, Gygi SP, Griffin PR, et al. The Secreted Enzyme PM20D1 Regulates Lipidated Amino Acid Uncouplers of Mitochondria. Cell. 2016; 166: 424–35. [doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071).

## Regulation of Lipid Metabolism

* Suzuki T, Muramatsu T, Morioka K, Goda T, Mochizuki K. ChREBP binding and histone modifications modulate hepatic expression of the Fasn gene in a metabolic syndrome rat model. Nutrition. Elsevier Inc.; 2015; 31: 877–83. [doi: 10.1016/j.nut.2015.01.005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2015.01.005).

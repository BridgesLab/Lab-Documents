# Purpose

# Experimental Details

Link to the protocol used (permalink preferred) for the experiment and include any notes relevant to your analysis.  This might include specifics not in the general protocol such as cell lines, treatment doses etc.

# Raw Data

Describe your raw data files, including what the columns mean (and what units they are in).

```{r data-input}
library(readr) #loads the readr package
filename <- 'testfile.csv' #make this a separate line, you can use any variable you want
data <- read_csv(filename)
```

These data can be found in `r getwd()` in a file named `r filename`.  This script was most recently updated on `r date()`.

# Analysis

Describe the analysis as you intersperse code chunks

# Interpretation

A brief summary of what the interpretation of these results were

# Session Information

```{r session-information, echo=T}
sessionInfo()
```

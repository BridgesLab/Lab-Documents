Version 0.1 Updated 2012-06-10 Author: Dave Bridges
---------------------------------------------------

These files are generated via ReStructuredText.  For syntax details see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

Files are converted to html by the docutils python function rst2html::

    rst2html.py communication.rst communication.html
    
The HTML files are then uploaded to the website or blog in that format.  In some cases, they may be re-derived from source by the website software.  Additional semantic markup may also be added for web publication.

Versioning   
==========
Each document will have a subtitle indicating the version, update date and author(s).
The versioning of these document will be defined up as follows: 

* the major number (first digit after the decimal place) is increased when there are significant jumps in content
* the second number is incremented when only minor content or significant fixes have been added
* the revision number (third digit) is incremented when minor issues are fixed having no impact on the meaning (modified from Wikipedia's page on `version numbers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_number>`_).  
* New blog entries will be posted with changes to the major number increments, while minor changes will be incorporated within the post.

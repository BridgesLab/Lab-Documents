Publication Policy
==================

This document lists rules for publishing by my group.
This is a public document, provided for the information of current and prospective group members, collaborators and other interested parties.
As things evolve the repository containing document will track these changes.  
I would appreciate any suggestions or comments on these points.  
If you have any, please email me at dave.bridges@gmail.com or leave a comment at the relevant `commit`_.

Open Access Policy
------------------

The rationale for this policy is the belief that research should be made available to the largest number of people with the least possible barriers.
This is especially true for publicly funded research, in which the tax paying public should be able to have unlimited access to the fruits of their support but also extends to donors of charitable foundations and other sources of funding.
Science functions best where ideas, data, methodologies and interpretations are provided in a free and open manner and our group will endeavor to be as open and transparent as possible with respect to publications.

Publications From Our Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My group will publish only in journals in which online access is free and unrestricted.  
This is commonly known as **Gratis Open Access** where both access and reuse are unrestricted, except that attribution must be provided.
These may include journals that publish only open access papers, or journals in which open access is provided on a per article basis.  
If external funds are obtained to procure open access status of an article, this will be indicated as an acknowledgment in the article.
A list of journals which meet this criteria can be found at http://www.doaj.org/.

All members of our group will be made aware of this policy as early as possible, and this policy will be publicly available on the laboratory website.
The only exception to this is for invited review articles and book chapters, though where possible we will endeavor to support access to these publications as well. 

Collaborations with Other Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For publications in which we are not the primary laboratory performing the research we recommend publication in open access journals, though if there is strong dissent from the other principal investigators we will leave the decision to their discretion.

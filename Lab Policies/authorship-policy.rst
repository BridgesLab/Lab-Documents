What Constitutes Authorship?
----------------------------

The laboratory's policy on authorship as stated by the `International Committee of Medical Journal Editors`_ is:

    Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published. Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.

What is the Role of the Corresponding Author?
`````````````````````````````````````````````

The corresponding author, typically the primary investigator, is responsible for communicating with the editor and the other authors.  This is before, during submission and after publication.
The corresponding author will also respond to external inquiries regarding the paper and keep the other co-authors informed.

Acknowledgements
````````````````

Any person who contributed, but not enough to reach the role of authorship will be noted in the acknowledgments section.  This may include purely technical or writing assistance or general support.  


How Is Authorship Order Determined?
-----------------------------------

Authorship order will be determined by discussion between authors and the PI both at the outset of writing, and during any modifications.

Are co-equal authorships acceptable?
````````````````````````````````````
In some cases, authors in some groups are listed as equal (for example co-first authors).  This will not be the case for our group.
All authors will be discretely listed in a specific order.  For more details about why co-equal authorships are not a good idea see the discussion at the `Drug Monkey Blog`_.

How Are Authorship Disputes Resolved?
-------------------------------------

First, co-authors will be encouraged to come to a fair agreement.  If co-authors cannot agree, then disputes will be mediated by the PI.

What Constitutes Authorship?
----------------------------

What is the Role of the Corresponding Author?
`````````````````````````````````````````````

Acknowledgements
````````````````

Unacceptable Authorship
```````````````````````

How Is Authorship Order Determined?
-----------------------------------

Are co-equal authorships acceptable?
````````````````````````````````````
In some cases, authors in some groups are listed as equal (for example co-first authors).  This will not be the case for our group.
All authors will be discretely listed in a specific order.  For more details about why co-equal authorships are not a good idea see the discussion at the `Drug Monkey Blog`_.

How Are Authorship Disputes Resolved?

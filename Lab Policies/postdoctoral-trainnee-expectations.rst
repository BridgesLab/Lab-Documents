Postdoctoral Trainee Expectations
==================================

This document lists the expectations for a postdoctoral fellow in my group.  This document is publicly available so is intended to be used in a transparent way.  
These policies are in addition to but do not supersede any human resources policies.
As things evolve the repository containing document will track these changes.  
I would appreciate any suggestions or comments, internal and externally.  If you have any please email me at dave.bridges@gmail.com or leave a comment at the relevant commit_

What is expected of the trainee
---------------------------------

Conduct
    Both myself and trainees (either mine, or co-supervised trainees) will read, discuss and sign a contract describing our roles and responsibilities both as a trainee/employee and a mentor.  They will be responsible with keeping their work area and common areas tidy and neat.
    
Hours
    The expectation is a 40h work week, typically daytime during the week but it is acknowledged that there may be times where work may go over these times or to the weekend.  It is up to the trainee to plan their experiments accordingly.   
    
Technical Support
    No designated technicians will be provided to a postdoctoral trainee, though in consultation with the mentor a lab technician may be used where necessary.
     
Project Selection
    Projects will be selected in consultation with the mentor.  Postdocs will typically have independent domain over their project, if overlaps with other projects occur then these will be discussed and separated on a case by case basis.  If the trainee wishes to diverge substantially from the agreed upon line of research, this will be done after discussions between the trainee and the mentor.
    
Funding Expectations
    Trainees will be expected to apply for appropriate postdoctoral fellowships and will write these applications with support from the mentor and other group members.
    
Data Presentation and Storage
    All data will be presented in lab meeting, including potentially useful troubleshooting experiments.  All data will be logged into the LIMS system and detailed notes will be left in the lab at all times.  Detailed protocols will be logged into the laboratory protocol database.
    
Journal Club and Lab Meetings
    Regularly scheduled lab meetings and journal clubs will be attended and postdocs are expected to select and present articles of their choosing.  Trainees will be required to write a brief synopsis of the paper and our discussion, which will be published on the laboratory's website.
    
Manuscripts, Fellowships and Presentations
    Trainee will be expected to write, or contribute to the writing of all presentations, or manuscripts derived from their work.  This will be done in consultation with the mentor and other members of the group.  Appropriate timing for publication or sharing of data will be determined by discussions among all relevant contributors.

What is expected of the mentor?
--------------------------------

Career Development
   At least twice annually, the mentor and trainee will discuss both short and long term career development planning.  A framework such as an individual development plan will be generated and updated at this time.  For an example see `FASEB's Individual Development Plan`_
   
Skill Development
   If a technique is required for a project to progress, the mentor will make a reasonable effort to provide, or send the trainee for that training.  In turn, the trainee will be expected to share those skills with the rest of the group.
   
Meetings
   When funds permit, the mentor will send the trainee to up to one meeting per year, providing that reproduced, publication quality data can be presented by the trainee.  The same work can not be used for multiple meetings.  It will be the trainee's responsibility to report back to the group any pertinent findings from these meetings.
   
Presentations
   When the mentor presents data he will always acknowledge the trainee's contributions and post-presentation discuss with the group any pertinent questions or comments from the audience.
   
Administrative Duties
   All relevant ordering, administrative and compliance issues will be primarily handled by the mentor, though input will often be sought regarding specific needs.

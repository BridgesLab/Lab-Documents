Sample and Data Storage Policy
=================================

These are the lab expectations for tracking and storing data.  
If we cant follow the entire provenance of your data, we can neither trust or publish it.  Keeping an up to date notebook is essential both for lab members while they are here and for future people after you leave.  
Physical lab notebooks should never have things removed and must stay in the laboratory.  Notes will be kept in binders and arranged by experiment.  
Do not keep separate binders for separate studies.  
If several people are working together on an experiment, one person has to be designated as responsible for all the notes and data entry for that experiment.  
If you have any questions or suggestions, please email me at dave.bridges@gmail.com or leave a comment at the relevant `commit`_.

Data and Sample Archiving
---------------------------
It is the responsibility of anyone doing an experiment to ensure that both hard and electronic copies of data are available, easy to find and easy to understand.  
The bar we set is for a competent lab member to be able to see what you did, how you did it, and where the samples and results are located.  
This should be possible both electronically and by looking at your lab notebook.

Samples
~~~~~~~~

Samples should be stored in the appropriate freezer or fridges.  
Samples have to be placed in a box, and that box should be in the appropriate place as labelled on the freezer.  
Your notes have to indicate the name on the box.  
If there are multiple experiments in the box, you need to label on the top of the box, or with a printout folded inside the box which experiments correspond to which samples.  
Tubes need to be labelled with enough information so that if the box is dropped, we can figure out which experiment each sample belongs to.

Raw Data
~~~~~~~~~

Raw data that is not electronic should be converted to electronic format whenever possible via scanning or copying into spreadsheets.  
Handwritten data should be placed  with the notes and protocols for the experiment.

Electronic Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Electronic data (images, spreadsheets, scripts, calculations, etc) must be stored on the lab file server, not on USB drives and not on individual computers.  
The file server is backed up periodically and is the safest place to keep electronic data.  
Data should be within your folder in the shared drive, and that folder should be organized appropriately.  
Your lab notes must indicate the location of electronic data on the server (ie what directory the data is in).

Notes and Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For each experiment you will normally have at least three things, a notes page describing what you were testing, a print out the protocol and note any alterations on the protocol.  
For things not indicated on the protocol (ie which antibodies you used, at which concentrations, or which primers you used), you will need to  write that on the notes page.  
If you think you may have made a mistake then also, mark that in your notes or on the protocol sheet.  
The protocol sheet, plus your notes and printouts of graphs or other data must be stapled together as one experiment in your notes.  
Also attach printouts or copies of collected raw data.  
Your notes must also indicate where samples are stored and what folder the electronic data is in.  

Experimental Metadata
----------------------
In addition to your lab notes, all experiments must be logged into the lab LIMS system.  
This should include links to the protocols and reagents used as well as all raw and processed data.  
You will need to write some brief notes about the experiment, especially noting deviations from the protocol.  
You will also need to summarize the results when entering those.  
A competent scientist should be able to completely reproduce your experiment by looking at **either** your notes or your LIMS entry.

Enforcement
-----------

Periodically, both your notes and your experimental metadata will be inspected by either the PI or someone in the lab, to ensure that we can follow what you did, where the raw data is, how things were calculated and where the results can be found.
